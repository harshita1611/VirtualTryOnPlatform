# Virtual Try-On Platform

Welcome to the Virtual Try-On Platform! This project allows users to visualize how clothing will look on them by using advanced face-swapping technology. It captures an image of the userâ€™s face and seamlessly swaps it with the face of a fashion model wearing the selected clothing. This project leverages the power of machine learning with a Hugging Face model called `inswapper` and is built with a modern tech stack.

## Features

- **Face Swapping:** Accurately swaps the user's face with that of a fashion model to give a realistic preview of how the clothing will look.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication powered by Clerk.
- **Frontend:** Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Backend:** Python-based server using Flask, handling image processing and face swapping.
- **Extensible:** Future plans include integrating AR/VR technology for an immersive experience that can extend beyond fashion to furniture and other items.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **Machine Learning Model:** `inswapper` (Hugging Face)
  
## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `roop/roop` directory:
    ```bash
    cd roop/roop
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

1. Sign in using your credentials (handled by Clerk).
2. Upload your image with a full face view.
3. Select the clothing item you want to try on.
4. The platform will process the images and display the result with your face swapped onto the model.

## Future Scope

- **AR/VR Integration:** Extend the platform to include AR/VR capabilities, allowing users to visualize not only clothing but also furniture, accessories, and more in a 3D environment.
- **Expanded Item Visualization:** Enhance the platform to include a wide range of items, offering a comprehensive virtual shopping experience.
